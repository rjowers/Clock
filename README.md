In this project I created a clock with JavaScript.
The goal of this assignment was for us to have a more solid understanding of the DOM,
general JavaScript syntax and to understand how to properly use SASS variables & syntax.
Here is the link to it if you want to check it out : https://rjowers.github.io/Clock/.
